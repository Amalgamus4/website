        I started my journey to become a self taught software developer in March
        2021. I had previously worked a multitude of varying jobs from
        restaurants, to manufacturing, to welding, to machine maintenance.
        Nothing I had worked at was really something I felt I wanted to do the
        rest of my life, however. I'm not sure what made me decided to become a
        software developer, but once I made up my mind nothing could change it.
        I am learning as much as I can as quickly as possible and hope to be
        ready to start applying for jobs within the next year.

        I have been happily married for almost 5 years to an amazing woman and
        have two children, two cats, and a dog.

      I have built this website using skills I learned from tutorials. I have
      also completed The Odin Project's Foundations course and am currently
      working on the their full stack Javascript curriculum.

      My CSS skills are still rather rudimentary, but will progress in the
      coming months.

    <p>
      Since having gained a firm understanding of HTML and CSS basics, I have
      began an extensive study of Javascript which will continue for many months
      to come.
