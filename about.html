        I started my journey to become a self taught software developer in early
        2021. I had previously worked a multitude of varying jobs from
        restaurants, to manufacturing, to welding, to machine maintenance.
        Nothing I had worked at was really something I felt I wanted to do the
        rest of my life, however. I'm not sure what made me decided to become a
        software developer, but once I made up my mind nothing could change it.
        I learned everything I could as quickly as possible, which isn't easy
        when balancing a full time job and a family. Now that I have a decent
        knowledge of the necessary languages, I am ready to begin my career as a
        software developer.

        I have been happily married for almost 5 years and have two children,
        two cats, and a dog.

      I have built this website using skills I learned from tutorials. Many
      weeks of trial and error have produced the page in front of you now.

      I have a cursory knowledge of programming and Javascript and will begin a
      more in depth learning after making sufficient headway in HTML and CSS.
